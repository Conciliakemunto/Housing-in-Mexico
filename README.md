📌 Overview
This project explores the key drivers of housing prices in Mexico using a dataset of over 21,000 🏠 Housing Prices in Mexico - Data Science Project
property listings. The main goal is to determine whether property size or location plays a more significant role in determining property prices. The entire analysis was done in Python using Jupyter Notebooks, following a full data science process

🔍 Steps Performed
1. Data Preparation
•    Combined multiple CSV datasets into a unified dataframe.
•    Handled missing values and data type issues  
•    Cleaned and standardized column names and units  
•    Exported cleaned data for modeling  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
•    Summary statistics for price, size, and location variables  
•    Correlation heatmaps and visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots)  
•    Price distribution by city and property type  
3. Feature Engineering  
•    Created new variables: price per square meter, region-based location encoding      
4. Modeling  
•    Linear Regression models to estimate the relationship between housing price, size, and location     
•    Performance evaluation using R-squared, MAE, and RMSE    
•    Discussed and visualized model performance   



🛠️ Technologies Used  
•    Python  
•    Jupyter Notebook  
•    pandas, numpy  
•    matplotlib, seaborn  
•    scikit-learn  

📊 Key Insights  
•    Location shows a stronger correlation with price than property size.  
•    Major urban areas like Mexico City and Guadalajara exhibit higher average prices.  
•    Cleaned and transformed dataset is ready for future modeling.  

Project Status
Ongoing (more models and visualizations to be added).
